4. What is the minimum viable product, that we can produce and still call the project a "success"? What form will the results take? (i.e. a diagram, a report, a few paragraphs, a presentation?) How long will it be? 

5. When do we want those results by? Are there milestones along the way?

6. Who is a part of the project? Who is taking ownership of it?

7. What are some expected hurdles or roadblocks we might encounter?
