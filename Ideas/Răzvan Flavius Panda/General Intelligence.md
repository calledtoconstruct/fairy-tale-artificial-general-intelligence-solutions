_General Intelligence (GI) is the intelligence of a system that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can._ - adapted from Wikipedia definition of AGI

Intelligence is a metric - let's say one dimensional for now

It measures how good a system is at achieving any possible goal under any context - by convention the higher the value of the metric the better the system is at performing actions which would allow it to achieve any goal under any context

A system is a spatial slice of the universe

A goal is any constraint/convergence on the possible futures

A context means that the system could be put in any possible environment

Environment would be everything outside of the system - the rest of the world

^ How full reality determinism would interfere with this should be accounted for - whether it matters or not
